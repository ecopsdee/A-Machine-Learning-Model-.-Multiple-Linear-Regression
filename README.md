# A-Machine-Learning-Model-.-Multiple-Linear-Regression
I used Machine Learning to design a System that can accurately predict the price of a car.

This system should be used by customers looking to know the true worth/value/price of a car. This will enable them to bargain better with a car sales man. 

Nobody likes to spend more when they can get something for less. 

You can contribute to the code.

I am available for collaborations.
